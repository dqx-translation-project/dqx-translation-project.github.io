# Welcome

Our small team maintains a variety of utilities to empower English-speaking players of the MMORPG Dragon Quest X (DQX).

For help, the team hangs out in the [DQX Worldwide Discord](discord.gg/dragonquestx). Post your questions in the **#clarity-questions** channel.

dqxclarity is a Python program that enables the game to display in English. It uses both a live translation service and modded game file to render English in the game client.

Several of DQX's settings (Sound, BGM, controller settings, keyboard settings, etc.) are controlled in an external utility packaged with the game named `DQXConfig.exe`. This configuration is entirely in Japanese and additionally will display a bunch of question marks if you don't have the Japanese language pack installed on your computer. It has been updated to reflect the English language instead.

## dqxlauncher <a href="https://github.com/dqx-translation-project/dqx_en_launcher"><img src="asset/github-mark.png" alt="github-mark" width="17"></a>

DQX's launcher is entirely in Japanese. This version of the launcher does some swaps of the Japanese assets (images and text) with English assets. This makes it easier to navigate and read error messages.

## send to chat <a href="https://github.com/dqx-translation-project/dqx-send-to-chat"><img src="asset/github-mark.png" alt="github-mark" width="17"></a>

DQX has several quests that require you to type in Japanese in order to progress. This can prove difficult as your average English player does not know how to type in Japanese. Additionally, there is no copy/paste support in the game.

This tool aims to solve this by pasting the Japanese into the chat box for you. Most of the known chat quests are embedded in the program and you can simply select them from a dropdown.
